	<h2><center>THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK <br> POLICY ON ACCEPTABLE USE OF COMPUTER RESOURCES</center></h2>

	<ol type="I">
	<li>
	<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
	</li>

	<p>
    CUNY’s computer resources are dedicated to the support of the University’s mission of education, research and public service. In furtherance of this mission, CUNY respects, upholds and endeavors to safeguard the principles of academic freedom, freedom of expression and freedom of inquiry. CUNY recognizes that there is a concern among the University community that because information created, used, transmitted or stored in electronic form is by its nature susceptible to disclosure, invasion, loss, and similar risks, electronic communications and transactions will be particularly vulnerable to infringements of academic freedom. CUNY’s commitment to the principles of academic freedom and freedom of expression includes electronic information. Therefore, whenever possible, CUNY will resolve doubts about the need to access CUNY Computer Resources in favor of a User’s privacy interest. However, the use of CUNY Computer Resources, including for electronic transactions and communications, like the use of other University-provided resources and activities, is subject to the requirements of legal and ethical behavior. This policy is intended to support the free exchange of ideas among members of the CUNY community and between the CUNY community and other communities, while recognizing the responsibilities and limitations associated with such exchange.
	</p>

	
	<li>
	<h4>APPLICABILITY</h4>
	</li>

	<p>
	This policy applies to all Users of CUNY Computer Resources, as defined in Article III below. This policy supersedes the CUNY policy titled “CUNY Computer User Responsibilities” and any college policies that are inconsistent with this policy.

            <li>
            Users may not access a CUNY Computer Resource without authorization or use it for purposes beyond the scope of authorization. This includes attempting to circumvent CUNY Computer Resource system protection facilities by hacking, cracking or similar activities, accessing or using another person’s computer account, and allowing another person to access or use the User’s account.

            Notwithstanding subsection 1.a. above, a User may authorize a colleague or clerical assistant to access information under the User’s account on the User’s behalf while away from a CUNY campus or when the User is unable to efficiently access the information on the User’s own behalf (including as a result of a disability), but delegated access will be subject to the rules of Section 10 – Security, below.
            </li>
            </p>

            <li>
            CUNY Computer Resources may not be used to gain unauthorized access to another computer system within or outside of CUNY.

            Use of CUNY Computer Resources is generally limited to activities relating to the performance by CUNY employees of their duties and responsibilities, by students in connection with their college courses and activities, and by retired CUNY teaching faculty, librarians, and other retired employees approved by the college president or where the employee is a member of the Central Office staff then by

the Chancellor or his or her designee. For example, use of CUNY Computer Resources for private commercial or not-for-profit business purposes, for private advertising of products or services, or for any activity meant solely to foster personal gain, is prohibited. Similarly, use of CUNY Computer Resources for partisan political activity is also prohibited

            Except with respect to CUNY employees other than faculty, where a supervisor has prohibited it in writing, incidental personal use of CUNY Computer Resources is permitted so long as such use does not interfere with CUNY operations, does not compromise the functioning of CUNY Computer Resources, does not interfere with the User’s employment or other obligations to CUNY, and is otherwise in compliance with this policy, including subsection 2.a. above. Users should be aware that personal messages, data and other information sent or received through a User’s CUNY account or otherwise residing in a CUNY Computer Resource are subject to CUNY review pursuant to Section 13 of this policy and may also be subject to public disclosure pursuant to FOIL.

Users of CUNY Computer Resources may not state or imply that they speak on behalf of CUNY or use a CUNY name, trademark or logo without authorization to do so. Affiliation with CUNY does not, by itself, imply authorization to speak on behalf of CUNY.

            CUNY employs various measures to protect the security of its computer resources and of Users’ accounts. However, CUNY cannot guarantee such security. Users are responsible for engaging in safe computing practices such as guarding and not sharing their passwords, changing passwords regularly, logging out of systems at the end of use, and protecting Non-Public University Information, as well as for following CUNY’s IT Security Policies and Procedures.

            Users must report incidents of non-compliance with IT Security Policies and Procedures or other security incidents to the University Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, and the Chief Information Officer at the affected User’s college.

        <li>
        <b>Filtering.</b> CUNY reserves the right to install spam, anti-malware, and spyware filters and similar devices if necessary in the judgment of CUNY’s Office of Information Technology or a college IT director to protect the security and integrity of CUNY Computer Resources. CUNY will not install filters that restrict access to e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms or websites based solely on content, unless such content is illegal, such as child pornography sites.

        </p>
        
        <p>
        <li>
        <b>Confidential Research Information.</b> Principal investigators and others who use CUNY Computer Resources to collect, examine, analyze, transmit or store research information that is required by law or regulation to be held confidential or for which a promise of confidentiality has been given are responsible for taking steps to protect such confidential research information from unauthorized access or modification. In general, this means storing the information on a computer or auxiliary hard drive that provides strong access controls (passwords) and encrypting files, documents, and messages for protection against inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure while in storage or in transit over data networks. Robust encryption and passwords must be used to protect Non-Public University Information, and is strongly recommended for information stored electronically on all computers, especially portable devices such as notebook computers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and portable data storage (e.g., auxiliary hard drives, memory sticks) that are vulnerable to theft or loss, as well as for information transmitted over public networks. Software and protocols used should be reviewed and approved by CUNY’s Office of Information Technology. In addition, the steps taken to protect such confidential research information should be included in submissions to the CUNY Institutional Review Board reviewing the research protocol.

            <p>
            <li>
            <u>Copying</u>. CUNY may copy a User’s account and/or hard drive on a CUNY Computer Resource, without monitoring or inspecting the contents of such account and/or hard drive, at any time for preservation of data or evidence, without notice to the User.
            </li>

            <p>
            <li>
            <u>General Monitoring Practices</u>. CUNY does not routinely monitor, inspect, or disclose individual usage of CUNY Computer Resources without the User’s consent. In most instances, if the University needs information located in a CUNY Computer Resource, it will simply request it from the author or custodian. However, CUNY IT professionals and staff do regularly monitor general usage patterns as part of normal system operations and maintenance and might, in connection with these duties, observe the contents of web sites, e-mail or other electronic communications. Except as provided in this policy or by law, these individuals are not permitted to seek out contents or transactional information, or disclose or otherwise use what they have observed. Nevertheless, because of the inherent vulnerability of computer technology to unauthorized intrusions, Users

have no guarantee of privacy during any use of CUNY computer resources or in any data in them, whether or not a password or other entry identification or encryption is used. Users may expect that the privacy of their electronic communications and of any materials stored in any CUNY Computer Resource dedicated to their use will not be intruded upon by CUNY except as outlined in this policy.
